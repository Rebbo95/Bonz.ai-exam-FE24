## Introduction
This project is a basic hotel website built with HTML and CSS. The website includes the following pages:

- **Landing Page**: A welcoming page for the hotel.
- **About Page**: A page describing the hotel and its facilities.
- **Booking Page**: A page where users can search and "book" rooms (this is static, as no actual booking functionality is implemented).


## Project Plan
1. **Landing Page**:
   - Introduce the hotel with a welcoming message and basic navigation.
   - Include a hero section with an image and a call to action.
   
2. **About Page**:
   - Provide a description of the hotel and its key facilities.
   - Use images to highlight the hotel's offerings, such as rooms, amenities, etc.

3. **Booking Page**:
   - Allow users to "search" for available rooms, "static results".
   - Include a simple form for check-in and check-out dates.

## Technical Requirements
- **Responsive Design**: The site should work on both small and large screens (375px-576px and >1000px).
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: Used for layout and positioning.
- **BEM(Block-Element-Modifier**: Used to create a clean code structure.
- **No Errors in Google Lighthouse**: The site should pass accessibility, performance, and SEO checks with no errors.

## Notes:
3. The project uses a single CSS file (`styles.css`) for styling.
